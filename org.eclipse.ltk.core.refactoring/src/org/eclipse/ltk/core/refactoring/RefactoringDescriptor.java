/**
 * Descriptor object of a refactoring.
 * <p>
 * A refactoring descriptor contains refactoring-specific data which allows the
 * framework to completely reconstruct a particular refactoring instance and
 * execute it on an arbitrary workspace.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Refactoring descriptors contain the following information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a short description string, which provides a human-readable text
 * designed to be displayed in the user interface to represent the refactoring
 * in trees and lists. Descriptions are automatically generated by refactorings.</li>
 * <li> an optional comment string, which provides a full human-readable
 * description of the refactoring. Comments are automatically generated by
 * refactorings and provide more refactoring-specific information, such as which
 * elements have participated in the refactoring. </li>
 * <li> refactoring descriptor flags, which tell the framework what capabilities
 * a certain refactorings has when executed in a remote context. </li>
 * <li> a timestamp, measured in UTC milliseconds from the epoch, which denotes
 * the original execution time of the refactoring. </li>
 * <li> a unique ID, which denotes a certain kind of refactoring (ie. Rename
 * File). This ID is usually composed of the plugin identifier of the
 * contributing plugin and a plugin-wide unique identifier (ie.
 * <code>org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring.renameFile</code>). </li>
 * <li> the optional name of the project this refactoring is associated with.
 * Note that the project name is not available if the refactoring cannot be
 * associated with a single project, or the refactoring descriptor has been read
 * from a file which cannot be associated with a project. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Refactoring descriptors are identified by their refactoring id
 * {@link #getID()} and their time stamps {@link #getTimeStamp()} and are
 * potentially heavy weight objects which should not be held on to. Use
 * refactoring descriptor proxies {@link RefactoringDescriptorProxy} to present
 * refactoring descriptors in the user interface or otherwise manipulate
 * refactoring histories.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients which create specific refactoring descriptors during change
 * generation should choose a short, informative and human-readable description
 * of the particular refactoring instance and pass appropriate descriptor flags
 * to the constructor. More details about a particular refactoring can be
 * revealed in the comment, which can contain more text with
 * refactoring-specific information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All time stamps are measured in UTC milliseconds from the epoch (see
 * {@link java.util#Calendar}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: this class is indented to be subclassed by clients to provide
 * specialized refactoring descriptors for particular refactorings.
 * </p>
