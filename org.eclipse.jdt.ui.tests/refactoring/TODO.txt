(random order)

. order TODO list according to importance
. see the comment in RenameProvateMethodRefactoring.isVisible
	(does it mean the tests are unreliable and we have to test things manually?)
	(it's a bug, but where?)
. find better names for renameMethod classes, actions and wizards
. nls
. unify the method names in UndoManager
. support for 'scripts':
	.after you do a series of refactorings you can dump the refactoring stack
		and perform the same series on another mashine, for instance, from the generated 'script'

UI
? add change log action
? drag and drop support for move type/method/field

OTHER REFACTORINGS
	more interesting
		. inline temp
		. abstract method in superclass
		. move type
		. push down method 
		. pull up method
		. inner-type rename
		. split class (insert a new class into the hierarchy)
		. pull up field
	less interesting
		. make class abstract/non-abstract
		. convert temp to query
		. change the access qualifier of a type/method/field
		. move method
		. add a method parameter
		. push down field
		. abstract field
		. reorder type members
		. make type non/final
		
TESTS
	.rework tests - lots of duplicated code in helper methods
	.tests for method renaming and inner type issues
	.tests showing that StubUtility.findMethod uses declared type names, not fully qualified ones
	.tests for refactorings performed on multiple files in multiple packages
	.overloading and methodRename

ORG.ECLIPSE.JDT.REFACTORING.CHANGES ISSUES
. what level of abstraction should the changes be?
   .for instance: should there be RemoveClassChange or only TextSubstitute?
		
SPECIFIC REFACTORING ISSUES

	SAFE DELETE METHOD REFACTORING
	. in case of virtual methods - do we remove all the hierarchy?
	
	SAFE DELETE TYPE REFACTORING
	. do we delete a type/method if it refers to itself (and nobody else)?
	. should there be SafeDeleteRefactoring class?
		(and SafeRenameMethod/Type would be its subclasses)
	.if the type is top level and there's no other type in that cu the cu should be removed
		(option maybe)
		(or create SafeRemoveCompilationUnitRefactoring)

	RENAME METHOD REFACTORING
	. MUST unify the way we look for methods that have to be renamed
		now the logic is duplicated heavily
	. the working copy business
	. overloading issues
	. how do ensure that at most one 'rename method' menu item shows up when ou rightclick?
