<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added "Edit Working Set..." to JDT view menus</li>

<li>
Inline Call - new refactoring to inline a method call. To activate the
refactoring select a method invocation in a compilation unit editor and
select <i>Inline Call</i> from the refactoring menu. Current limitations
are:</li>

<ul>
<li>
only one single call can be inlined</li>

<li>
a call can only be inlined if the call and the actual declaration resides
in the same compilation unit</li>

<li>
no checking is done if method to be inlined is reimplemented in subclasses.</li>
</ul>

<li>
New Quick fixes</li>

<ul>
<li>
Fix usage of non visible methods/ fields, types and imports</li>

<li>
Fix access of instance variables in static contexts</li>

<li>
Fix for abstract methods in non-abstact types</li>

<li>
Fix type has unimplemented abstract methods</li>

<li>
Fix to add additional catch clauses for uncaught exceptions</li>
</ul>

<li>
New API class: <tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt>: Classpath container
pages that implement <tt>IClasspathContainerPage</tt> can optionally implement
<tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt> to get additional information
about the context when the page is opened.</li>

<li>
JUnit Plugin Tests (not part of the SDK, but available as an optional plugin). 
The launching was changed to be more compatible with PDE. This avoids plugin version conflicts
and supports running tests with references to external plug-ins (not all referenced plugins have
to be available as binary projects).</li>

</ul>

<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added Behavior tab to Java Editor Preference Page for smart insertion/skipping
of parenthesis and brackets, smart wrapping of strings</li>

<li>
Compiler preference page contains new options; new tab created</li>

<ul>
<li>
Task markers: Compiler generates markers when special keywords are detected</li>

<li>
Deprecated in deprecated: Select if the usage of deprecated API&nbsp; is
shown if the method is already deprecated.</li>
</ul>

<li>
New preference page to specify the sort order of members in Java views</li>

<li>
<b>Move to Previous/Next Member</b> - use Ctrl+Shift+Down/Ctrl+Shift+Up
to quickly navigate between methods, types, fields and initializers</li>

<br>The action is also available from the <i>Edit</i> menu
<li>
<b>Extract Interface</b> refactoring - creates a new interface with a set
of method and makes the selected class implement the interface.</li>

<br>Also, an option is provided to change references to the class into
references to the new interface (where possible).
<br>The refactoring can be activated by selecting a class and choosing
the appropriate entry from the context or global <i>Refactor</i> menu.
<li>
<b>Move Inner Class to Top Level</b> refactoring - select an inner class
and choose the appropriate action from</li>

<br>the context or or global <i>Refactor</i> menu. A new compilation unit
will be created and the inner class will be moved to that compilation unit.
<br>Where necessary, references will be updated. If the class is not static,
then a field is created to access the enclosing instance.</ul>
