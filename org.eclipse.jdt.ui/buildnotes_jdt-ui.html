<pre>
- Experimental views which show Javadoc and the Declaration for the element at the current
    cursor position. Use Window > Show View > Other... > Java to open them.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input June 3rd 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- JUnit - introduced a JUNIT_HOME class path variable. When creating a new test case 
    with the test case wizard then the user has the option to put JUNIT_HOME on the build
    class path.
- The browsing views now also follow the caret position if "Linking with Editor" is enabled
    in the view menu.
- The range indication in the Java editor is synchronized with the caret position if
    the editor preference is enabled (default for a new workbench).
- The source tool tip is now shown in a source viewer.
- The Outline view no longer synchronizes immediately but after a delay once the caret remains
    at the same position.
- NOTE: The Java editor preference "Synchronize outline selection and range indication on
    caret move" will be removed for M2: it will always be enabled.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 27th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Type hierarchy structured view: CTRL + T in the editor on a type, method or package.
- Improved dialogs for Generate Getter/Setter, Override Method and Delegate method: Insertion point, visibility, and comment generation
- Released first version of rename refactoring participants. The old rename refactoring actions are still
  in place. To enable a second Rename action which uses participants go to Preferences>Java>Work in Progress
  and enable the 'Rename with Participants' refactoring.
- Fixed bug 37846. To do so we had to break the API of the class org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.SelectionDispatchAction. 
  See document apichanges_jdt-ui.html for a describtion how to deal with the breakage.
- Editor
	- Introduced "Smart Opening Brace". To enable go Preferences>Java>Work in Progress.
	- Smart typing mode is enabled per default. Ctrl+M toggle the typing mode between "smart" and "raw". The default typing actions
	  such as auto indent, automatic addition of '"', ']', ')', '}', Smart Semicolon, and Smart Opening Brace adhere to the typing mode.
	- The automatic insertion of '}' has been changed to happen on <Enter> rather than on typing '{'.
