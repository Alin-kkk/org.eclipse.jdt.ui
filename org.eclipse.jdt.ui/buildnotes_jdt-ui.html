<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added link-like navigation for declarations to Java editor.
While the Control key is pressed, text over which the mouse hovers and which
have a declaration turn into links which can be clicked. The link color can
be changed on the Java Editor Appearance Preference page.
</li>
<li>
Applied patch submitted by Scott Rutledge to go into top level type in Java outliner.</li><li>Added
new view menu option in the Package Explorer called "Layout" which allows
to switch between "Flat" and "Hierarchical" (default is flat). The "Hierarchical"
layout displays the package structure in a tree. There is also a preference
(Java -&gt; Appearance) <br>
which allows to set if empty package fragments are folded together when in hierarchical view (default is folded).</li>
  <li><i>Work in progress:</i> Java Editor hovers can now be configured per
modifier (Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Editor -&gt; Hovers).
The enable/disable button in the workbench toolbar affects all configured
hovers.<br>
  </li>
<li>
Applied patch submitted by Sebastian Davids. It adds the new template variable ${year}.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
Eclipse Platform Build Notes&nbsp;<br>
Java Development Tooling UI</h1>
Eclipse Build Input October 29<sup>th</sup> 2002
<h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added new 'Promote Local Variable to Field' refactoring - to perform, select
a local variable in the editor and choose 'Promote Local Variable to Field'.
You can then select the field's visibility and other modifiers (if applicable).
If the variable is initialized on creation, then the refactoring allows
moving the initialization to the class' constructors or the new field's
declaration.</li>

<li>
Added new 'Convert Anonymous Class to Nested Class' refactoring - to perform,
select an anonymous class delcaration and choose 'Convert Anonymous to
Inner'. You can then choose a name and visibility for the new class. The
refactoring then also passes accessed local variables to the new class
via added constructor variables. This refactoring is useful for instance
when you realize that your inner class has grown too big to be anonymous.
Btw, you can then (if it ever grows even more or proves to be more generally
useful) move it to top level by using the 'Move Nested to Top Level' refactoring.</li>

<li>
Added new shortcut to Java Editor: "Open Declaration" can now be triggered
with Ctrl-Left Mouse Button as well.</li>

<li>
Added first batch of Mac OS X keybindings.</li>

<li>
A new icon is used for an empty package that contains resources.</li>

<li>
New property page on Java projects to define project specific compiler
settings.</li>

<li>
New UI to define special tasks tag. Task tags can be used in comments and
the compiler will generate a marker when detected. Example usage of a task
tag is 'TODO' to mark code that has to be revisited.</li>

<li>
Added name guessing for the Extract Constant refactoring.
</li>
<li>
JUnit: added support to find and navigate to tests that reference a particular type or method.
The action is in "Navigate&gt;Go To&gt;Referring Tests".
</li>
</ul>

<p>Eclipse Build Input October 9<sup>th</sup> 2002
</p><h2>
What's new in this drop</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Added "Edit Working Set..." to JDT view menus</li>

<li>
Inline Method - new refactoring. To activate the refactoring, select a
method invocation in a compilation unit editor and select <i>Inline Method</i>
from the refactoring menu. Alternatively, select a method declaration in
the editor.</li>

<br>You can choose between inlining only the selected method call or inlining
all calls (in which case you can also delete the method).
<br>Note that currently no checking is done if method to be inlined is
reimplemented in subclasses.
<li>
Change Signature refactoring: Modify Parameters refactoring has been enhanced
to add and remove parameters. Also, the parameter types and the method
return type can be changed. The declaration of the method, declarations
of methods overriding/implementing it and all invocations are updated accordingly.</li>

<br>Currently, to change the method's name Rename refactoring should be
used. This will change in a future release - Change Signature will allow
renaming the method too.
<br>To activate - select a method or constructor and choose <i>Change Signature..</i>
from the <i>Refactor</i> menu.
<li>
Use Supertype Where Possible refactoring: new refactoring that replaces
usages of a type with one of its supertypes.</li>

<br>It computes the largest set of references that can be updated.
<br>To activate, select a type and choose <i>Use Supertype Where Possible...</i>.
<li>
Extract Constant refactoring: new refactoring to create a constant (a static
final field) out of a selected expression. To activate, select an expression
in the editor and choose <i>Extract Constant</i> from the context or global
<i>Refactor</i> menu. You can replace all matching or only the selected
expression.</li>

<li>
New Quick fixes</li>

<ul>
<li>
Fix usage of non visible methods/ fields, types and imports</li>

<li>
Fix access of instance variables in static contexts</li>

<li>
Fix for abstract methods in non-abstact types</li>

<li>
Fix type has unimplemented abstract methods</li>

<li>
Fix to add additional catch clauses for uncaught exceptions</li>
</ul>

<li>
New API class: <tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt>: Classpath container
pages that implement <tt>IClasspathContainerPage</tt> can optionally implement
<tt>IClasspathContainerPageExtension</tt>
to get additional information about the context when the page is opened.</li>

<li>
JUnit Plugin Tests (not part of the SDK, but available as an optional plugin).
The launching was changed to be more compatible with PDE. This avoids plugin
version conflicts and supports running tests with references to external
plug-ins (not all referenced plugins have to be available as binary projects).</li>
</ul>

<br>Also, an option is provided to change references to the class into
references to the new interface (where possible).
<br>The refactoring can be activated by selecting a class and choosing
the appropriate entry from the context or global <i>Refactor</i> menu.
<li>
<b>Move Inner Class to Top Level</b> refactoring - select an inner class
and choose the appropriate action from</li>

<br>the context or or global <i>Refactor</i> menu. A new compilation unit
will be created and the inner class will be moved to that compilation unit.

then a field is created to access the enclosing instance.</ul>
