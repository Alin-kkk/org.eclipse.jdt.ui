========== Eclipse Build Input October 26th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Move instance method refactoring has been reimplemented in order to support generics,
  inlining, removing of delegators, organizing of imports and to resolve visibility issues
- Convert anonymous refactoring now fully supports generics
- Pull up/Push down refactorings organize their imports and leave javadoc formatting intact
- Serial version quick fix calculation now launches a separate VM
- there's now an Externalized String hover which shows the externalized
  value when hovering over an NLS key in the Java editor.
- pushed Quick Fix/Assist command down to org.eclipse.ui.ide, see <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=74675">bug 74675</a> for details.
- calls to reconcile a CU have been improved by only enabling the JDT UI's
  problem requestor when reconcile(...) is called by the Java reconciler, hence problems
  are now only reported to JDT UI's problem requestor when the Java reconciler calls
  reconcile(...). Note that clients requesting an AST when calling reconcile(...) will
  now get null or an empty AST due to bug <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=76738">76738</a>. Either use the ASTProvider to get the AST or enable
  (and disable later) the problem requestor.
- the AST provider no longer clears the cache when an editor gets deactivated. This
  reduces the number of AST creations.
- bug fixing
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 19th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- the Properties File editor now offers syntax highlighting, improved
  double-clicking behavior and a separate font preference. The colors can
  be configured under Java > Properties File Editor.
- the Properties File compare viewers now offer syntax highlighting, improved
  double-clicking behavior and a separate font preference. The colors can
  be configured under Java > Properties File Editor.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 12th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- added Search > Implement Occurrences which finds all method
  declarations implementing or extending the selected type
- mark occurrences can now mark all method declarations implementing
  or extending the selected type. This feature can be disabled in
  the preferences: Java > Editor > Mark Occurrences > Mark implementors
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input September 21th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- bug fixing
- the Java editor retargets the properties action i.e. the command to open
  the properties dialog is enabled when the Java editor has focus
- the Java editor's Convert Line Delimiters To sub-menu has been moved from Source to Edit menu
- there's a new Edit > Change Encoding... action which reuses the encoding
  field editor from the properties dialog
- the Rename refactoring handles now also type parameters and
  occurrences of types in actual type parameter lists
- Push Down/Pull Up refactorings support now generics
- integrated advanced quick assists for conditionals (see bug 71244)
  and 'Convert to enhanced for loop' quick assist
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input July 27th 2004 ==========<br>
<pre>
- bug fixing
- hyperlinking in Java editor now supports URLs
- Merged JDK 1.5 branch back to head. Refactorings and Quick fixes now
  use AST API level JSL3.
