========== Eclipse Build Input November 20th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- new refactorings Introduce Factory and Generalize Type
- Type hierarchy outline supports toggling between super- and subhierarchy
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input November 18th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Added encoding support for Java compare (not yet enabled)
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input November 11th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Adapted the code which does the blue-coloring for showing links in the editor
  to use the new ITextPresentationListener
- Added hover support for local variables
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 28th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Occurrences of the selected element can be highlighted in the Java editor
  (Java > Work in Progress > Mark occurrences in file). These Search annotations
  can be highlighted (see Annotation preference page) and also quickly removed
  using the Remove Occurrence Annotations source command (default: Alt+Shift+U).
- The "Disable overwrite mode" preference has been promoted from the Work in Progress
  preference page to the Java Editor's Typing preference page.
- Vertical ruler annotations can be disabled via editor's Annotation preference
  page.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 21th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- The Java editor now updates the editor status line with problem annotation
  messages while typing.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input October 7th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- The Package Explorer's built-in filters (fields, non-public members and static
  members) have been moved to the filter dialog (View menu > Filters...).
- Formatting has been extended to also format Javadoc if it is specified in the Java
  preferences. The preferences can be found on the Java Code Formatting preference page.
- "Format Element" is a new formatting action which formats the element at the cursor position. This
  is either a Javadoc comment, a method, a type, etc.
- "Correct Indent" bound to Ctrl+I in the default key binding corrects the line indentation
  of the selected lines.
- The Java editors use docment providers which retrieve their documents from the file buffers manager. Thus
  ther is how document updating between Java editors and Default text editors if they have been opened on the
  same file.
- The Java editors update the status line and the problems/tasks view according to the current caret position.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input September 30rd 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- View menus which contain a "Filter..." entry now also contain the 3 last recently
  changed filters
- New Refactoring: Introduce Parameter ...
  Moves a selected selected expression to all call sites and reference the expression
  through a new parameter. The current implementation doesn't consider ripple methods
  nor does it recode the selected expression to fix accessibility problems.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input September 23rd 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Improved Change Method Signature refactoring
- Support for reference updates when moving local types
- Improved auto indentation

</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input August 26th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>

- Added enclosing project scope Java search actions to context menus
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input August 19th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- The JDT Editor and its preference page now use marker annotation preferences
  declared in org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor plug-in. This enables the
  editor to show new markers/annotations if they have a marker annotation
  specification.
- The JDT extends now ExtendedJavaEditor, an additional layer combining features 
  used in rich editors, such as the annotation, line number and overview rulers, 
  the print margin, current text highlighting, and quick diff.
- Fixed Java auto indentation after conditionals / loops without braces (e.g. <code>if</code> 
  statements without block).
- Added block commenting and uncommenting actions.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input August 13th 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- Replaced "Go to Next Error" and "Go to Previous Error" with configurable
  "Go to Next Annotation" and "Go to Previous Annotation"
- F2 opportunity is shown in smaller font and can be disabled (preference)

    cursor position. Use Window > Show View > Other... > Java to open them.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input June 3rd 2003 ==========<br>
<pre>
- JUnit - introduced a JUNIT_HOME class path variable. When creating a new test case 
    with the test case wizard then the user has the option to put JUNIT_HOME on the build
    class path.
- The browsing views now also follow the caret position if "Linking with Editor" is enabled
    in the view menu.
- The range indication in the Java editor is synchronized with the caret position if
    the editor preference is enabled (default for a new workbench).
- The source tool tip is now shown in a source viewer.
- The Outline view no longer synchronizes immediately but after a delay once the caret remains
    at the same position.
- NOTE: The Java editor preference "Synchronize outline selection and range indication on
    caret move" will be removed for M2: it will always be enabled.
</pre>
========== Eclipse Build Input May 27th 2003 ==========<br>

  in place. To enable a second Rename action which uses participants go to Preferences>Java>Work in Progress
  and enable the 'Rename with Participants' refactoring.
- Fixed bug 37846. To do so we had to break the API of the class org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.SelectionDispatchAction. 
  See document apichanges_jdt-ui.html for a describtion how to deal with the breakage.
- Editor
	- Introduced "Smart Opening Brace". To enable go Preferences>Java>Work in Progress.
	- Smart typing mode is enabled per default. Ctrl+M toggle the typing mode between "smart" and "raw". The default typing actions

	- The automatic insertion of '}' has been changed to happen on <Enter> rather than on typing '{'.
