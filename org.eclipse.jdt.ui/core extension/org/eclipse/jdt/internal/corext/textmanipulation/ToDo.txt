- copy process is current complicated. As soon as somebody forget to copy the text range
  correctly the whole text buffer might be messed up. We should think about a more
  closed world. May be we can make the SimpleTextEdit final. Another solution is to
  remove all constructors that take an text range object. That ensure that we also 
  create a new one from two ints.
  
- get text range could return a copy, but then we have to adjust all the TextEdit.adjust*
  methods. No this is not necessary since outside the text edit infrastructure nobody
  can modify a text range. The methods are package visible.
  
- need way to head-less batch changes in editors into one undo object.
